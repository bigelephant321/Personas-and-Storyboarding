        Personas and Storyboarding: An Exploration of CVS Self Checkout
    </h1>
    <body>
        <h2>
            Below, we have a diagram of the CVS self-checkout interface
        </h2>
        <img src="diagram.jpg" alt="diagram" width="600" height="600">
        <h2>
            Here are some some observations I had when watching people use this interface:
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users are fairly quick to walk up to an open machine, given the “OPEN” screen when it is not being used</li>
            <li>Most users intuitively start scanning quickly after starting</li>
            <li>There are shelves to put items on the right and left of the checkout. One is weighted, and is where items are supposed to go</li>
            <li>One user put their item on the wrong shelf, and had to get an employee to bypass a screen when the scale did not register weight</li>  
            <li>The user process slows down when users reach the paying stage</li>
            <li>Users pause to read each screen (donation, payment options) when paying</li>
            <li>Users are easily able to make the switch from self-checkout screen to card reader, especially when prompted</li>
            <li>Payment on card reader is smooth</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            Below are questions I asked them about their experience, and some answers I got
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Did you struggle with any aspect of the self-checkout experience?
                <ul>
                    <li>“There are a lot of steps to finish and pay, but I didn’t really struggle”</li>
                    <li>“I put my bagged items on the wrong side”</li>
                    <li>“No”</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Did you have to get employee help for bypassing an issue?
                <ul>
                    <li>“No”</li>
                    <li>“Yes, the machine rang the employee for help when I did not put my items in the right spot”</li>
                    <li>“No”</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Was the interface easier or harder to navigate then what you would expect for a self-checkout experience?
                <ul>
                    <li>“Pretty standard”</li>
                    <li>“Aside from the employee help part, it was pretty easy”</li>
                    <li>“There are more steps than I would like, but not necessarily difficult”</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Is there anything missing from the self-checkout experience?
                <ul>
                    <li>“I can’t really think of anything”</li>
                    <li>“Maybe a way to resolve issues by myself? If I put something in the wrong place, I should be able to move it and resolve the problem. Especially if the employees are dealing with other customers this is annoying”</li>
                    <li>“No”</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>SUMMARY: People are able to use the self-checkout pretty easily. There may be some improvements to make in terms of streamlining the checkout process and where to put groceries, but overall satisfactory. The biggest problem is 
                when a user needs employee overrides
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            From these observations and interactions, I developed two, abstract "personas" built out using empathy maps:
        </h2>
        <ul class="persona-gallery">
            <li><img src="Oliver.jpg" alt="diagram" width="600" height="600"></li>
            <li><img src="Waldo.jpg" alt="diagram" width="600" height="600"></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            Finally, I created a storyboard to document the start to finish user experience for Albert:
